# Objective
We will analyze in this article the data that comes from the image analysis of Tulear zooplankton (Madagascar).

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
SciViews::R
```


```{r importation}
data <- read("zooplankton", package = "data.io")

```
```{r graphique}
library(ggridges)
chart( zooplankton, class ~ perimeter %fill=% class) + 
  geom_density_ridges(show.legend = FALSE)

```

We see on this graph that the perimeters are roughly the same for each of the classes except for the Malacostracan, Decapods, Clyclopoids , Calanoids and Annelids which can go up to 25 meter. We can observe that the Chaetognaths can go beyond the 25m and the Cnidarian can go up to 50m.
